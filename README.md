# Natours
## Overview:
Natours is a fictional company that provides tours in various settings.

## Project:
The goal here was to take a deep dive into CSS and really understand how and why CSS properties work. All of my work up to this point has been focused on logic, so I figured it was time to really put the "font" in "front end." ...Okay, that wasn't very good but I think you know what I mean. Check it out and all the cool details I learned: {link will go here later}.
